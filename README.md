### Parallel software solution
We choose MPI + OpenMP/OpenACC/CUDA as our heterogenous computing environment. 

### Data science problem
Many huge data sets are now publicly available. There are several ways to turn those large amounts of data into useful knowledge. 
Here we focus on exploratory data analysis, or unsupervised machine learning, which means finding structural information without prior knowledge.

Processing huge data sets are typically computationally-intensive. Here's where parallel computing comes to rescue.

### Some data set options 
(Preliminary plan. Might change in the future.)
